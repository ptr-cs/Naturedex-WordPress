# Naturedex accessibility verification

The engineering target is WCAG 2.2 Level AA, with a separate mapping to the applicable Revised Section 508 web requirements (which incorporate WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA). This document records scope and evidence; passing automated checks alone does not establish site-wide conformance.

## Automated checks

`npm run test:e2e` starts a private in-memory WordPress site on `127.0.0.1:4322`, so tests never touch a working site. `npm run test:a11y` runs the accessibility subset, using axe on rendered pages. Tests also assert accessible names, keyboard interaction, focus, and page overflow. A result is evidence only for the tested route, state, browser, and build.

Reports are written to `playwright-report/`; failures keep screenshots and traces in `test-results/`.

### What this edition changes for accessibility

- Public pages are rendered by PHP, so content, headings, and links exist before and without JavaScript. A browser test covers the guide, a species page, and an article with JavaScript off.
- Controls that only work with JavaScript (filters, seen toggles, map buttons, the motion control) are hidden when it is off, rather than shown and inert.
- Card titles are links that TypeScript upgrades to dialog buttons, so without JavaScript they lead to the species page.
- Region map buttons have no no-JavaScript filter. The full species list remains available as the map's text alternative.
- Content written in the block editor is outside the automated scans. Authors are responsible for image alternatives and heading order there.

The automated scope is the same set of states as the first Naturedex: catalog, map, journal, writing desk, animal dialog, new-post form, article preview, a published article, and the paused and reduced-motion states. Results for the current build are in [docs/comparison.md](comparison.md#measured-results).

## Manual assessment record

All manual assessments below are **not evaluated** until a person performs the procedure and records the result. Test the main catalog, a filtered catalog, an entry detail, the regional map, an article, and the writing desk including validation errors and save/delete flows.

| Area | WCAG criteria to assess | Procedure | Current manual result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text alternatives | 1.1.1 | Review whether animal sprite/image alternatives and map equivalents communicate the relevant information; decorative art should not create noise. | Not evaluated |
| Structure and relationships | 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 2.4.6 | Use a screen reader's heading, landmark, list, and form navigation. Check order and relationships in every view. | Not evaluated |
| Color and contrast | 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.11 | Check text, focus indicators, controls, selected states, badges, and map markers. Confirm information remains understandable without color. | Not evaluated |
| Reflow and text adjustment | 1.4.4, 1.4.10, 1.4.12 | Check 200% text enlargement, 400% zoom, a 320 CSS-pixel viewport, and text-spacing overrides. Confirm essential content and controls remain usable. | Not evaluated |
| Keyboard operation | 2.1.1, 2.1.2 | Complete catalog search/filter, entry selection, region selection, reading, blog create/edit/publish/delete using only a keyboard. Check that no control traps focus. | Not evaluated |
| Focus and navigation | 2.4.1, 2.4.3, 2.4.7, 2.4.11 | Use the skip link; inspect visible focus, logical order, focus after view changes and modal closure, and focus visibility behind sticky content. | Not evaluated |
| Target sizes | 2.5.8 | Check small icon buttons, tabs, map markers, filters, and close controls at desktop and mobile sizes, accounting for applicable exceptions. | Not evaluated |
| Forms and errors | 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3 | Submit an incomplete or invalid article; inspect instructions, labels, error identification, correction guidance, focus, and retained input. | Not evaluated |
| Name, role, value and status | 4.1.2, 4.1.3 | Check control states and announcements for filtering, save, publish, delete, empty results, and request failures using VoiceOver/Safari or another documented browser/assistive-technology pair. | Not evaluated |
| Parsing under the 508/WCAG 2.0 mapping | 4.1.1 (WCAG 2.0) | Validate generated markup for duplicate IDs and malformed relationships; retain this mapping even though WCAG 2.2 removed this success criterion. | Not evaluated |

For each assessed item retain: standard/version, criterion, route or component, interactive state, procedure, automated report if applicable, manual result, source version, date, browser/assistive technology, and linked remediation issue. Use pass, fail, not evaluated, or not applicable with a rationale.

## Content authoring

The blog editor should support meaningful titles, readable excerpts, structured headings, and related species references. Test content quality as well as editor controls: an automated check cannot determine whether descriptions, headings, sources, or animal-identification cues are accurate and useful.

Map associations represent illustrative regional habitat guidance rather than exact animal sightings. The visible text/list equivalent must remain available independently of interpreting the map graphic.
